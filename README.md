# Demo project for creating pop-ups in Angular

This the source code for a project I wrote on [Medium](https://medium.com/@robert.streidt/make-pop-up-windows-in-angular-without-breaking-a-sweat-7a5319199a7c) about creating pop-ups in Angular without the aid of 3rd party libraries.

## Usage

Use the `app-pop-up` component tag to show enclosed content in a pop-up window. Open and close the pop-up window using the `isOpen` boolean input value.

## Demo

Here is a sample pop-up I created with `app-pop-up`:
